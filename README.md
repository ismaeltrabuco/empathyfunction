> *"Empathy, I believe, must become code."*

A prototype implementation of **Empathetic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs)**, born from the fusion of mathematics, physics, art, and human behavior understanding.

## What The Empathy Function Does

The Empathy Function measures **dynamic alignment between a system's internal state and external feedback**, enabling AI systems to not just predict, but to *interpret* human-like signals through mathematical empathy.

Classical operator theory (as seen in Sauer’s formulations) updates a system by applying an operator $T$:

####   **y_{t+1} = T(y_t)**


**Our version transforms this rule** into a feedback-alignment mechanism:

### *yt + 1 ​= yt ​+ λ⋅ cov (yt​, ot​)* ###

Where:

* **y_t** = current system state (the “self”)
* **o_t** = external observations (the “other”)
* **λ** = sensitivity factor regulating responsiveness
* **cov(y_t, o_t)** = our empathy operator, measuring co-variation between self and other

Intuitively: the system is like a heart listening to another’s heartbeat — it doesn’t erase its own rhythm, but shifts slightly toward resonance. That’s the *empathy step*.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/empathy-function.git
cd empathy-function
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Example

```python
import numpy as np
from empathy_package import EmpathyScorer, EPINNModel

# Example dataset
data = {
    'visits': [980, 1020, 880, 1100, 970],
    'stories': [3, 4, 2, 5, 3],
    'clicks': [200, 220, 190, 250, 205],
    'moon_phase': [2, 3, 4, 0, 1],
    'sales': [38, 42, 33, 48, 37]
}

scorer = EmpathyScorer()
emp_scores = scorer.calculate_empathy(data)

model = EPINNModel(physics_constraints=['attention_conservation'])
model.fit(data, emp_scores)
preds = model.predict(data)

print("Empathy Scores:", emp_scores)
print("Predictions:", preds)
print("Visitor IDs:", model.generate_visitor_ids())
```
